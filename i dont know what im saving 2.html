    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>Hi, my name is Joshua Salanitri and I'm 23 years old from melbourne.</p>
      <img src="pom.jpg" width="240" height="320"/>
    <p>My Hobbies include playing games and playing soccer. I completed Year 12 in 2016 at Viewbank College and I studied IT in year 11.<br/> I've really felt a growing love for IT in the past 2 or 3 years as I really got into PC gaming and wanted to learn how everything works and want to immerse myself in the world more.</p>
    <p>I love building computers. I've built 8 now (i think), most being quite high end gaming PCs for my friends.<br/> I play indoor soccer with my friends and outdoor soccer for Watsonia Heights FC as an attacking midfielder.<br/>
       With pretty much every other hour of my day I'm playing games with my friends. My favourite games are Destiny 2, Minecraft, Apex Legends, COD and Beat Saber. <br/> <br/> Also this is Ollie.</p>

      <h2>Interest in IT</h2>
      <h4>What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any).</h4>
    <p>I've always had an interest in IT , having chosen IT in all electives at high school, but I really started developing my serious interest in IT in the last 1 or 2 years, especially during covid lockdown.<br> My interest at first was purely hardware related, I loved building and tinkering with PCs, after getting unlucky with multiple parts being shipped already broken it developed into some extensive troubleshooting. <br>At that point i started to really enjoy myself while doing anything IT related,<br> to the point where i was going to teach myself how to program in java to try and make minecraft mods and i thought to myself how much i would enjoy a career in IT if it was all i wanted to do in my spare time.</p>
    <h4>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</h4>
    <p>I chose to come to RMIT/OUA for a number of reasons, I really like the idea of studying from home.<br> It gives me a lot of flexibility to continue living my life without changing too much.<br> Another reason was the RMIT course was specifically recommended to me by a friend who completed the course last year.</p>
    <h4>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</h4>
    <p>I expect to learn a lot of different skills from every aspect of IT. I'm quite excited to learn how to program and learn networking.<br> I'm also looking forward to and expect to learn a lot of skills that will help me get a job, such as planning projects and working with others in groups.</p>

    <h2>ideal job</h2>
    <p>My ideal job in the IT field is probably a software developer.<br> I have identified this carsales job ad as a great example of something I would love to do in the future.</p>
    <p>The job has a wide number of roles and responsibilities that would keep it fresh,<br> like rolling out new features to the website and experience but also maintaining the current software.<br> This is really appealing because it would really annoy me if I got stuck doing one role at a company.<br> IT is such a broad field and I would hate to waste the potential that it has.</p>
    <p>The role is looking for people who have experience in a professional business environment,<br> as well as programmers experienced in C#, .NET and .Net Core as well as experience with AWS, Amazon's cloud service.</p>
    <p>While obviously not having any of that knowledge or experience right now i'm looking forward to finish my studies and gain experience and knowledge in these fields so that one day i can hope to fill a position like this</p>
    <p>To get to a position like that I'm definitely going to have to finish my bachelors in IT here at OUA/RMIT and find a junior developer job,<br> and gain experience in the field while also possibly taking more courses and learning different languages depending on the languages that we learn later in this course.</p>

    <h2>Profile</h2>
    <p>After completing the Myers-Briggs test, emtrain learning style test and big 5 personality test, the results didn't surprise me at all.</p>
    <p>My result for the Myers-Briggs test was ‘Virtuoso’. Virtuoso so someone who likes hands-on learning, trial and error and problem solving.<br> Their strengths are that they are optimistic, creative and rational and weaknesses are that they are stubborn and hard to get to know.<br> While the test itself has been scientifically written off, I still find that some of the key points are still quite accurate.</p>
    <p>The next test was the emtrain learning style test. My result here was that my primary learning style was pragmatist with a score of 41%.<br> Good learning methods for pragmatists include practicals, discussion and problem solving relating quite well with my results above.</p>
    <p>The final test I completed was the big 5 personality test where my result was 48% openness, 15% conscientiousness, 69% extraversion, 35% agreeableness and 65% neuroticism.<br> These results I feel this is the least accurate test about me, saying I care more about social achievements and I also think quite negatively about myself.</p>
    <p>The results reflecting my learning and working style are quite positive.<br> The test results stating that I am a very hands-on learner and that I like and am good at problem solving makes me feel very confident I've chosen the right career path.<br> I feel it will really benefit me in my studies as well.</p>
    <p>Scoring high in extraversion and the fact that pragmatists react well with discussion and group work I think this will really help when working with a team. <br> I’m very friendly and like bouncing ideas off other people but I'm also really easily agreeable and I'm happy working on someone else's idea. <br> When forming a team im going to be content with most groups, as i’ll work well with and get along with most people in the course</p>
